### before you reading this please check my github repo. on [Github](https://github.com/shameelabdullanp/droid-Emoji "github.com/shameelabdullanp/droid-Emoji"). and also check relased packages on relase page

this moudle can not be added to magisk manager directly becouse of font issue.
>> But you can install from relase page

this moudle is supported various devices including AOSP devices and samsung devices

####What this module do?

working of this moudle is very simple, Changing noto color font to a specific ttf file that is used in unrelased emoji version

####Can i use edit the Emojis?

technicaly "YES",but changing emoji in your device won't change the unicode Emojis standrds.can possibly change the unicode charectors my using ttf changer or your self and replacing the noto-color font well change on *your device*
