## Hello world,    
Thank God! What A Wonderful Year...

The last year was something special for my personal and professional existence.
I lost something priceless that no one can fix it  And now, glancing back on it, I just recall the good stuff.  
>This birthday, I am once again reminded of the bountiful joys that I have reaped from my friends and family, and how blessed I am >to have so much love from everyone around me. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. :two_hearts:
